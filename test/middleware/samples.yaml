a correct g2o request is authenticated and does not return an error code:
    server:
        key:
            v1: "s3cr3tk3y"
    client:
        path: "/abc"
        version: 1
        nonce: "v1" 
        key: "s3cr3tk3y"
    expect:
        statusCode: 200
        body:
            authenticated: true

a data header must be present:
    server:
        key:
            v1: "s3cr3tk3y"
    client:
        path: "/abc"
        version: 1
        nonce: "v1" 
        key: "s3cr3tk3y"
        dataHeader: "X-Hidden-Auth-Data-To-Pretend-Its-Not-There"
    expect:
        statusCode: 403
        body:
            authenticated: false
            message: "missing auth data header"

unsupported algorithms fail authentication:
    server:
        key:
            v1: "s3cr3tk3y"
    client:
        path: "/abc"
        version: 42
        signature: "houbahoubahop"
        nonce: "v1" 
        key: "s3cr3tk3y"
    expect:
        statusCode: 403
        body:
            authenticated: false
            message: "unsupported algorithm"

a sign header must be present:
    server:
        key:
            v1: "s3cr3tk3y"
    client:
        path: "/abc"
        version: 1
        nonce: "v1" 
        key: "s3cr3tk3y"
        signHeader: "X-Hidden-Auth-Sign-To-Pretend-Its-Not-There"
    expect:
        statusCode: 403
        body:
            authenticated: false
            message: "missing sign header"

an incorrect signature returns a 403:
    server:
        key:
            v1: "s3cr3tk3y"
    client:
        path: "/abc"
        version: 1
        nonce: "v1" 
        key: "wr0ngk3y"
    expect:
        statusCode: 403
        body:
            authenticated: false
            message: "invalid signature"

the client nonce must be known by the server:
    server:
        key:
            v1: "s3cr3tk3y"
    client:
        path: "/abc"
        version: 1
        nonce: "v3" 
        key: "m0res3cr3tk3y"
    expect:
        statusCode: 403
        body:
            authenticated: false
            message: "unknown nonce"

a timestamp outside the allowed window fails authentication:
    server:
        key:
            v1: "s3cr3tk3y"
    client:
        path: "/abc"
        version: 1
        nonce: "v1" 
        key: "s3cr3tk3y"
        time: 343958400
    expect:
        statusCode: 403
        body:
            authenticated: false
            message: "request time too far off"

the timeWindow parameter can be used to control the allowed time delta:
    server:
        key:
            v1: "s3cr3tk3y"
        timeWindow: 9999999999
    client:
        path: "/abc"
        version: 1
        nonce: "v1" 
        key: "s3cr3tk3y"
        time: 343958400
    expect:
        statusCode: 200
        body:
            authenticated: true

an alternate data header can be used:
    server:
        key:
            v1: "s3cr3tk3y"
        dataHeader: "X-Alternate-Auth-Data"
    client:
        path: "/abc"
        version: 1
        nonce: "v1" 
        key: "s3cr3tk3y"
        dataHeader: "X-Alternate-Auth-Data"
    expect:
        statusCode: 200
        body:
            authenticated: true
